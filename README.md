# Decentralized Peer Review platform with Chainlink Automation 

Learn tgether is a Decentralized Peer Review platform meant to demonstrate the capabilities of blockchain technologies and Decentralized Oracle Networks (via Chainlink Automation) to facilitate decentralized communities and their assets. In this project, communities (Called Subjects) can assess scholarly articles via a customizable peer review process. Using a credit system (creds) generated by peers, Subjects can vary from fully democratic to autocratic proving the flexibility granted when leveraging Decentralized Oracle Networks.

## Overview

The project consists of three primary smart contracts:

1. **learntgetherSubjects**: This contract manages the subjects or categories under which articles can be submitted. It allows for the creation of dynamic communities, each with its own set of rules and parameters for article submission and review.

2. **learntgetherReviewers**: This contract manages the reviewers who are responsible for reviewing the articles. It ensures that only qualified individuals (as defined by an article's subject) can review articles, thus maintaining the integrity of the review process.

3. **learntgetherArticles**: This is the core contract where articles are minted as NFTs. It integrates with Chainlink Automation to automate the review process, ensuring that articles are reviewed in a timely and efficient manner.

## Facilitating Decentralized Communities

### Dynamic Governance

The system is designed to be flexible, allowing communities to define their own rules and parameters. This means that each subject or category can have its own unique governance model. Whether a community desires a fully democratic approach where every member has a say or prefers a more centralized model, this platform can accommodate.

### Peer Review System

The peer review system exemplifies the power of decentralized decision-making. Reviewers, who are vetted and approved based on their credentials, review articles. The system ensures transparency and fairness, with Chainlink Automation automating the review process. This not only speeds up the review process but also ensures that the outcome is based on the consensus of qualified individuals.

## On-Chain Assets with Chainlink Automation

Every article submitted is minted as an NFT, making it a unique on-chain asset. The state of this asset (e.g., whether it's accepted or rejected) can be influenced by the decentralized community through the peer review process. Chainlink Automation plays a crucial role here, ensuring that the review process is carried out efficiently and that the consensus is recorded on the blockchain.

## Conclusion

Learn tgether is more than just a platform for publishing articles. It's meant to exemplify the power of decentralized communities and the potential of blockchain technology. By integrating Chainlink Automation, the project showcases how automation can enhance decentralized decision-making processes. We firmly believe that the principles demonstrated in this project have broad applications across various sectors. Whether it's buying groups determining which products to procure, homeowners' associations selecting contractors, or public companies electing their board of directors, the potential applications are vast and varied.

## Future Plans
This project was designed as a proof of concept, exemplifying group ownership of meaningful on-chain assets. The next steps are to integrate with the Graph Protocol and design our frontend at https://tgether.io
